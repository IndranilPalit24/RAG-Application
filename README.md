RAG Application - Business Decision Assistant Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation

This project implements an Enterprise Business Decision Assistant using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a large language model (LLM). The assistant helps business users make informed decisions by retrieving context-aware information based on specific domains like finance, marketing, operations, and more. Built using Streamlit and Hugging Face's Transformers, the application supports real-time Q&A interactions with user-friendly responses. The repository is a prototype for an AI-powered tool to aid enterprise-level decision-making.
